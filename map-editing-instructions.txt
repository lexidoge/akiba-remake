REQUIREMENTS:
Hammer source world editor - Comes with most source games, GMOD version highly recommended. Can be found in GarrysMod/bin/hammer.exe
Map resources (more on this later)
Map vmf file - Latest version is on GitHub
GitHub Desktop - Can be found here: https://desktop.github.com/ 

SETUP:
Create your own branch for editing (I dont know yet if this is the correct way to do this but it should work?)
Install and set up GitHub Desktop and link it to lexidoge/akiba-remake (This respository)
It should automatically clone everything after set up?
Copy the materials and models folders from the cloned repository to GarrysMod/garrysmod/ (Your installation of GMOD)
Go to GarrysMod/bin and run hammer.exe
In Hammer, open the vmf file from the cloned repository

I also recommend setting your 3D view to 3D Textured Shaded Polygons for easier editing

EDITING THE MAP:
Go through the to do list adding changes from there and/or adding your own as you come up with new ideas (MAKE SURE TO ADD YOUR CHANGES TO THE TO DO LIST)
IMPORTANT: WHEN EXPORTING YOUR MAP TO TEST IN GAME ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RUN VIS, IT WILL KILL EVERYTHING AND YOU WILL BE VERY SAD
DO run BSP and RAD on FAST if you need it, also adding -noworkshop to the game options is nice to disable all mods for faster load times

COMMITTING YOUR CHANGES TO THE MASTER BRANCH:
In GitHub Desktop, in the "Changes" panel, select all relevent changes (NOT .log .prt .vmx, .bsp etc...) to the map vmf ONLY and commit them to your own branch

DEBUGGING:
Textures/Models aren't showing up:
Fix #1 - Restart Hammer
Fix #2 - Make sure you copied the models and materials folders to the correct place
Fix #3 - Go into the configuration window in Hammer and make sure all directories are pointing to your installation of GMOD
