Requirements:
Hammer source world editor - Comes with most source games, GMOD version highly recommended. Can be found in GarrysMod/bin/hammer.exe
Map resources (more on this later)
Map vmf file - Latest version is on GitHub

Setup:
Clone the GitHub repository from lexidoge/akiba-remake
Copy the materials and models folders from the cloned repository to GarrysMod/garrysmod/ (Your installation of GMOD)
Go to GarrysMod/bin and run hammer.exe
In Hammer, open the vmf file from the cloned repository

I also recommend setting your 3D view to 3D Textured Shaded Polygons for easier editing

Debug:
Textures/Models aren't showing up:
Fix #1 - Restart Hammer
Fix #2 - Make sure you copied the models and materials folders to the correct place
Fix #3 - Go into the configuration window in Hammer and make sure all directories are pointing to your installation of GMOD
